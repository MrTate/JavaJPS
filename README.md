# Jump Point Search
Jump Point Search algorithm implemented in Java. This is forked from [jps](https://github.com/kevinsheehan/jps) which started as a port of the JPS algorithm implemented in the [PathFinding.js](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js) project.

## Requirements
This library has been built using Java 8 up to this point. Making it compatible with other versions of Java is possible but at this point unlikely.

## Usage
There are four different rules that pathing Diagonally can follow.
- Always
- One Obstacle
- No Obstacles
- Never

You can check out the code within the Test directory for examples on how to use this within your own projects. But in the end it more or less comes down to these three lines:
```java
JPS<Tile> jps = JPS.JPSFactory.getJPS(new Graph<>(tileList), Graph.Diagonal.NO_OBSTACLES);
Future<Queue<Tile>> futurePath = jps.findPath(start, end);
Queue<Tile> path = futurePath.get();
```

### Distance and Heuristic
The code comes with four different distance algorithms already included but you are free to set your own as well.
The four you can choose from are: Manhattan, Euclidean, Octile, and Chebyshev.
```java
// Tile Map, Distance Calculation, Heuristic Calculation
new Graph<>(tiles, Graph.DistanceAlgo.MANHATTAN, Graph.DistanceAlgo.EUCLIDEAN);          
```

If you would like to set your own:
```java
BiFunction<Node, Node, Double> minDistance = (a, b) -> (double) Math.min(Math.abs(a.x - b.x), Math.abs(a.y - b.y));
graph.setDistanceAlgo(minDistance);
graph.setHeuristicAlgo(minDistance);
```

### Adjacent Stop
When finding a path you can have the goal include adjacent nodes. If you want all of the goal node's neighbors to be considered good endpoints:
```java
Queue<Tile> futurePath = jps.findPathSync(start, end, true);
```

If you want to have neighbors be goal nodes but to exclude the diagonal ones:
```java
Queue<Tile> futurePath = jps.findPathSync(start, end, true, false);
```
